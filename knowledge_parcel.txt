Shipping:
All products can be shipped to the European Union, the United Kingdom (uk) and Scotland. The shipping costs €12,55 within the EU and €14,55 to the UK. You will receive a tracking code to follow your parcel. The average delivery time is 3 to 5 working days.

We always dispatch each parcel as a “gift” that has a value of around €19 (±£16) to avoid any import fees for customers. All parcels are shipped discreetly and the products are vacuumed. 

Track your parcel:
If you received a tracking code by email, then you can use https://www.ups.com/gb/en/Home.page for UPS tracking codes and https://postnl.post/ for standard shipments. 

The shipping experience is good for most parcels, however, deliveries can be subjected to delayes. Unfortunately, we cannot do anything to speed up the delivery. We can dispatch a new parcel if the original parcel does not arrive within 2-3 weeks. If this is the case, then please contact us.
