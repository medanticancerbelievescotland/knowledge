UPS is a very reliable and fast shipping method offering standard and express deliveries. You would need to create your own label as if you were sending it from Amsterdam to your address. Simply send the created label (and invoice in case of an UK address) to us by email. This only takes a few minutes, but your order can be delivered much faster this way. 
We can also assist you by chat during this process, if you need any help, please reach out to us on Whatsapp, chat or email!
